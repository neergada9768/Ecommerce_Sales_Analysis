# Ecommerce_Sales_Analysis
E-Commerce Sales data for the year 2019 was obtained from Kaggle. The Data was merged, cleaned and useful insights were found using Python pandas. Important business questions were answered through this analysis. The Jupyter notebook file is divided into 3 segments:

1) Data Import
2) Data Cleaning
3) Exploratory Data Analysis

1) Data Import
The Sales data obtained from Kaggle had data divided monthly into different excel sheets. To use this data, I first merged all the 12 different excel sheets and sorted the rows according to the order date. Hence I obtained a single excel spreadsheet with the entire sales data of 2019

2) Data Cleaning
Data was analyzed thoroughly and some abnormalities were found out which needed to be cleaned. First, all the rows with Null values were dropped. The format of date and time was different in different rows hence a standard format was implemented overall through which we were able to extract the month, year and time. Further, new columns were added which included the month of order, the city, the state, and other details important for the analysis.

3) Exploratory Data Analysis
Important Business questions were asked during this phase of the data analysis. The questions answered were:
1) What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2) In which City was most of the product delivered?
3) What time should the business advertise the product to maximize the likelihood of buying?
4) What products are most often sold together?
5) Which is the top-selling product?

This Data Analysis Project gives keen insights into all the above questions and is very helpful for businesses to make changes in their listings.
